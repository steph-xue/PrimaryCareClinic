## What will the application do and who will use it? ###
The application serves as an EHR system designed for primary care clinics, providing an efficient way to manage all patients currently registered at a clinic. It displays a comprehensive, alphabetically sorted list of patients by last and first name, and allows clinicians to add new patient profiles, update existing information, or remove patients from the system. Each patient record allows for the tracking of both demographic and clinical information, including first and last name, date of birth (DOB), age, personal health number (PHN), allergies, medications, and medical conditions. In addition, the application allows clinicinas to create, edit, and delete clinical notes for patient visits, capturing key details such as the reason for the visit, visit summary, healthcare provider, and visit date. Clinicians can also view the full clinical history for any patient.

The primary care clinic application is designed to be used by medical professionals and administrative staff, including physicians, clinical pharmacists, nurses, and medical office assistants, to streamline patient management and ensure accurate record-keeping for the improved delivery of patient care.

## Why is this project of interest to you? ###
This project interests me because I have a background in the healthcare industry as a pharmacist and have worked at a variety of healthcare settings, including community pharmacies, hospitals, and ambulatory care clinics. I've worked with different EHR systems and understand the challenges healthcare professionals face when managing patient records. By building an EHR application, I can combine my healthcare knowledge with my technical skills to create a more efficient and user-friendly system for clinicians. It also supports my goal of using technology to streamline healthcare processes and improve overall efficiency.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developed with Java Swing to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Implemented in Java for lightweight, text-based interactions
  
### Backend
- Core application logic written in Java
- Unit testing conducted using JUnit Jupiter to ensure code reliability and maintainability


<br>

## User Interface Options
To maximize usability and accessibility, I implemented two distinct user interfaces that share the same backend logic. Both interfaces interact with the same model and persistence layers, ensuring consistency in behavior regardless of how the application is accessed. 

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Found in Main.java in the cli folder (main/ui/cli/Main.java)
- Offers a text-based interface ideal for terminal-based workflows
- Provides simple menu-driven navigation with input validation to guide users through interactions
  
### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Found in MainUI.java in the gui folder (main/ui/gui/MainUI.java)
- Provides a visual, user-friendly experience with clearly structured panels and a navigation bar that enables smooth switching between screens

<br>

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
OOP principles are fundamental to the architecture and design of my application. Core OOP principles such as modularity, reusability, the single responsibility principle (SRP), abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied throughout the application to ensure clean separation of models, reusability, and data integrity.

### Modularity and reusability
- Each major concept in my clinic system is modeled as its own class, making the system modular for maintability and reusability
- These include:
    - Clinic - manages and stores patients
    - Patient - stores individual patient data and clinical notes
    - ClinicalNote - holds individual clinical note entries for patients
    - Date - stores date-related logic

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has one main well-defined responsibility
- Helps to improve the scalability of the application, allowing new features to be added with minimal disruption to the existing codebase

### Abstraction and encapsulation
- Abstraction is employed to hide implementation details and expose only relevant functionality
- Encapsulation is achieved by designing each model class with private fields and public getter/setter methods, to ensure that an object’s internal state cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class, reducing the likelihood of bugs and unintended behavior


### Inheritance and polymorphism
- Writable is an interface that is implemented by model classes like Clinic, Patient, and Clinical note
- This allows polymorphic behavior when writing to JSON
  
<br>

## JSON-Based Data Persistance
To enable users to save and reload their clinic data between sessions, I implemented data persistence using custom JSON-based file readers and writers. This system allows users to choose between starting a new session or loading a previously saved clinic. It also ensures robust error handling for missing files, thus improving reliability.

### Writing data
- JsonWriter.java is responsible for converting the current state of the Clinic object into a well-structured JSON file, which includes all patients and their associated clinical notes
- This allows for easy storage, backup, and transferability of clinic data
- 
### Reading data
- JsonReader.java reads a previously saved JSON file
- It reconstructs the complete clinic state by creating new Clinic, Patient, and ClinicalNote objects based on the serialized data

<br>

## Unit Testing (JUnit Jupiter)
- Thorough testing was critical to ensuring the reliability and robustness of the application
- I used JUnit 5 (Jupiter) to write unit tests for every class and method in the model and persistence packages including:
    - Models:
        - TestClinic.java 
        - TestPatient.java
        - TestClinicalNote.java
        - TestData.java
    - Persistance:
        - JsonReaderTest.java
        - JsonTest.java
        - JsonWriterTest.java
- Every branch and conditional pathways were tested to ensure proper handling under all scenarios, resulting in 100% test coverage

<br>

## Event Log
The application automatically generates a detailed event log that tracks all significant actions taken during a session. This includes changes to clinic information, additions and updates to patient records, and any modifications to clinical notes. Each log entry includes a precise timestamp and a clear description of the action performed, providing a transparent and traceable history of user interactions within the system. This feature supports auditing, debugging, and better accountability for patient data management.

Sample event log record:
- Fri Mar 28 01:54:35 PDT 2025 - Clinic name set to Medicare Plus
- Fri Mar 28 01:55:26 PDT 2025 - Patient Mya Cornell added to the clinic
- Fri Mar 28 01:56:04 PDT 2025 - Patient Ashley Davis added to the clinic
- Fri Mar 28 01:56:36 PDT 2025 - Patient Amira Garcia added to the clinic
- Fri Mar 28 01:56:55 PDT 2025 - Set first name of patient Amira Garcia to Freya
- Fri Mar 28 01:57:00 PDT 2025 - Set last name of patient Freya Garcia to Kwon
- Fri Mar 28 01:57:19 PDT 2025 - Set date of birth of patient Freya Kwon to 10/27/1987
- Fri Mar 28 01:57:23 PDT 2025 - Set age of patient Freya Kwon to 54
- Fri Mar 28 01:57:29 PDT 2025 - Set personal health number of patient Freya Kwon to 946846634
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:00 PDT 2025 - Added new clinical note for patient Freya Kwon
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:15 PDT 2025 - Clinical note title set to Heartburn
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:25 PDT 2025 - Clinical note provider set to Dr. Nguyen
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:34 PDT 2025 - Clinical note body set to Patient presents with frequent heartburn and acid regurgitation
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:39 PDT 2025 - Removed clinical note for patient Freya Kwon
- Fri Mar 28 01:58:40 PDT 2025 - Patient Freya Kwon removed from the clinic
- Fri Mar 28 01:59:14 PDT 2025 - Clinic name set to Careplus

<br>

## Potential Design Improvements
There are some things I would refactor to improve the design of my project if I had more time:
- I would refactor the PrimaryCareClinicApp class of the UI package that runs the functionality of the command-line user interface by breaking it into smaller, seperate classes to ensure these classes align with the Single Responsibility Principle. This will ensure each class handles one distinct task (e.g. user input, command parsing, output display) to improve cohesion, readability and maintainability.
- For classes in the the model package, I would also try to abstract duplicated code into new methods. For example, I would abstract out code for addAllergy, addMedication, and addMedicalCondition into a separate method to minimize code dupication. Abstracting out duplicated code improves code reusability and enhances maintainbility, as updates to shared logic only need to be made in one place, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.
- I would refactor the NavigationBarUI class of the UI package so that instead of having multiple UI screen classes of the graphical user interface instantiating NavigationBarUI, I would just have it instantiated once for the entire application in the MainUI class. This would allow for a centralized control of navigation and prevent redundant instances, ensuring consistent behaviour across all UI screens.
