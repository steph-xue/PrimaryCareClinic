# Primary Care Clinic Application 

## An Electronic Health Record (EHR) designed to optimize patient management for clinicians working in primary care clinics

### What will the application do and who will use it? ###
The application serves as an EHR system designed for primary care clinics, enabling efficient management of patients who are currently registered within the clinic. The application faciliates the tracking of patient information, including first and last name, date of birth (DOB), age, personal health number (PHN), allergies, current medications (generic names), and any medication conditions. The patient data will be presented in a list view, where the user is able to organize patient records, sorting by information such as first name, last name, or DOB. The application will support the addition of new patients, removal of existing patients, and updates to patient details as required. Additionally, the application will allow users to add and review detailed patient notes to keep track of patient visits, including the date, reason for the visit, healthcare provider seen, and visit details. Users can view a complete history of all patient visits, organized chronologically for easy reference. 

The primary care clinic application is designed to be used by medical professionals and administrative staff, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and medical office assistants to streamline patient management and ensure accurate record-keeping for improve delivery of patient care.
